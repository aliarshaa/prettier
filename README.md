coding with a specific standard

In the world of coding, everyone likes to code in their own way and taste, and this is completely understandable and respected. But when you work in a team, this difference of experience may be annoying and troublesome.

therefore, one of the good solutions is to use the ".prettierrc" file. This helps you code in a team to a certain standard, even if everyone codes in theier own way.

use ".prettierrc" file for a custom standard.
use ".prettierignore" to ignore those file that you don't want prettier be applied to.
